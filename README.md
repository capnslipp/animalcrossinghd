# Animal Crossing HD

## How You Can Help

### Ripping Textures

The first step is to rip all textures from the game. 

1. Go into you **Graphics Configuration**
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab
3. Check off **Dump Textures**
4. Load the game

All textures that get loaded into memory will now be dumped into **Dolphin Emulator\Dump\Textures\GAFE01**

### Identifying/Organizing Textures

In order to properly keep track of and test all textures, they need to be identified and organized. 

### Creating HD Versions

You can use any program to create HD versions of textures, but there are a few rules:

1. It must be vector. Photoshop vectors are fine, as long as it can be enlarged to any size without loss in fidelity.
2. It must be as close to the original intent of animal crossing as possible. Our goal is to make the game HD without putting any personal spin on it.
